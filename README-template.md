## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup: Used a clean structure with div.image-card and div.text for clear separation of content.

- CSS custom properties: Implemented colors like #D5E1EF for the background and #FFFFFF for the card.

- Google Fonts: Integrated the Outfit font family (weights 400 and 600) for modern typography.

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively manage image overflow within a container. By using box-sizing: border-box and setting the image width: 100%, I ensured the QR code stayed perfectly within the white card regardless of the screen size.

I also practiced using opacity to create visual hierarchy between the heading and the description text:

### Continued development

- Flexbox Centering: Use display: flex on the body to center the card vertically and horizontally more dynamically.

- Relative Units: Transition from using px to rem for font sizes to improve accessibility.h your own plans for continued development.**
